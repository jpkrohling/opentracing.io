# Outreachy

The OpenTracing and Jaeger projects are happy to announce our participation in the Outreachy program, running
from December 2017 to March 2018. As part of this joint effort, we'll be collecting ideas for tasks related to
OpenTracing, Jaeger or both that would be appropriate for an intern to work on

## What is OpenTracing

OpenTracing is a vendor-neutral open standard for distributed tracing. For the motivation behind OpenTracing, 
we recommend watching the presentations available at the page [Talks and Videos](/talks-and-videos)

## What is Jaeger

Jaeger is a concrete set of tracers and a trace storage backend, for usage on applications and microservices
instrumented with OpenTracing. Its [GitHub main readme](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger) is a good 
starting point to understand what is Jaeger and how to start using it.

## Schedule
- October 23: - application deadline
- November 9: - selection decisions are made
- December 5 - March 5: - internship

## Coordination

* [Juraci Paixão Kröhling](https://github.com/jpkrohling)
* [Gary Brown](https://github.com/objectiser)

The coordinators can be contacted at any time. The easiest way is to send a message to the mailing list of either 
OpenTracing or Jaeger, as both coordinators are present on both mailing lists:

* [OpenTracing Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentracing)
* [Jaeger Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jaeger-tracing)

Another option is to use Gitter, which is the chat platform used by both the OpenTracing and Jaeger projects:

* [OpenTracing Gitter Channel](http://gitter.im/opentracing/public)
* [Jaeger Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/jaegertracing/Lobby)

## Mentors

* [Gary Brown](https://github.com/objectiser)
* [Pavol Loffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay)

Similar to contacting the coordinators, the mentors can be contacted at any time either by sending messages to
the mailing lists or Gitter channels.

Interested in becoming a mentor? Contact one of the coordinators!

## Available tasks

Coming soon. At this moment, we recommend looking at the following issue trackers for smaller tasks that might
give a sense of what's coming:

* [OpenTracing issue tracker](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Aopentracing)
* [Jaeger issue tracker](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Ajaegertracing)

Do you have an idea for a task that is suitable for this program? Contact the mentors or coordinators! Or
even better, volunteer for mentoring an intern during the work on your idea!

## Code of Conduct

Both OpenTracing and Jaeger are part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and have adopted its 
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
