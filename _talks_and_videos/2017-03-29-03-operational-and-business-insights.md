In this talk we will present Hawkular APM, an OpenTracing-compliant community project. We will demonstrate how the project can be used to monitor microservices in a cloud environment, capturing trace and business metric information, which can then be presented in both aggregated and individual trace views to provide useful insight for many roles within an organisation.
